Time Explanation:
----------------
The time recorded in time.txt represents the wall clock time in nanoseconds that the program took to find the target string. This includes:
- Time for genetic algorithm operations
- Time for string evaluations
- Time for file I/O operations

The time is measured using System.nanoTime() which provides high-resolution time measurements.

Sample Results:
--------------
The program uses a genetic algorithm to find the target string. Each run produces:
1. evaluate_XX.csv - Contains the evaluation scores for each attempt
2. plot_XX.pdf - Shows the convergence of the algorithm
3. time.txt - Records the total execution time
